# Fix: Budget Alerts Job Dependencies

## Problem Identified
The `budget-alerts` job was trying to use artifacts from `infracost-staging` and `infracost-production` jobs but didn't have proper dependency declarations. This created a race condition where the job could start before the artifacts were available.

## Error Scenario
```yaml
budget-alerts:
  name: Budget Monitoring
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
  # ❌ Missing: needs: [infracost-staging, infracost-production]
  steps:
    - name: Download staging costs
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: staging-costs  # ❌ May not exist yet!
```

## Solution Implemented
Added the missing `needs` dependency to ensure proper execution order:

```yaml
budget-alerts:
  name: Budget Monitoring
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [infracost-staging, infracost-production]  # ✅ Added dependency
  if: (github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main') || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main')
```

## Execution Order Now
1. **`infracost-staging`** and **`infracost-production`** run in parallel
2. Both upload their cost artifacts (`staging-costs` and `production-costs`)
3. **`infracost-summary`** waits for both jobs to complete (already had `needs`)
4. **`budget-alerts`** waits for both jobs to complete (now has `needs`)
5. Both summary jobs download and use the artifacts safely

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates race conditions
- ✅ Ensures artifacts are available before download
- ✅ Proper workflow execution order
- ✅ More reliable budget monitoring

## Jobs Dependencies Summary
- `infracost-staging`: No dependencies (runs immediately)
- `infracost-production`: No dependencies (runs immediately) 
- `infracost-summary`: `needs: [infracost-staging, infracost-production]`
- `budget-alerts`: `needs: [infracost-staging, infracost-production]` ✅ Fixed
